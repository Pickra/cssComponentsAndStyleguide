<textarea id="{{modifier_class}}-textareas" class="textarea {{modifier_class}}" rows="4">A hero can be anyone. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. My anger outweights my guilt. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight people Iike this but I will not become an executioner.</textarea>
