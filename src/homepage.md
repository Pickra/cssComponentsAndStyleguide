# @pickra/css-components

> A CSS library and styleguide using SASS, BEM AND Flexbox

## Features
- [WCAG 2.O](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) accessible colors
- Accessibility testing via [a11y](https://github.com/addyosmani/a11y)
- svg icons from [evil icons](http://evil-icons.io/)

The layout is built with CSS Grid,
which has pretty good broswer support.
But you should definitely
[check yourself before you wreck yourself](https://caniuse.com/#search=css%20grid).
The rest of the styles will still work without it.
