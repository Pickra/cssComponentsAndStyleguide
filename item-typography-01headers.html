                  <h1>H1 - Do you want a jelly baby?</h1>
<p>
    Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things.
    Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime.
    This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside.
    Life depends on change and renewal. My ship…my TARDIS… Oh my word!
    Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I am the Doctor!
    The original, you might say! Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie.
    Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened,
    it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.
</p>

<h2>H2 - Well I'm the Lord of Time</h2>
<p>
    Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book.
    Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings!
    I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory.
    Alright? Of course I'm alright, my child.
    You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition,
    I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs.
    I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon.
</p>

<h3>H3 - We are always in trouble!</h3>
<p>
    Isn't it extraordinary—it follows us everywhere.
    Well, it wouldn't be cricket. Oh, my giddy aunt! I was being chased by a giant dinosaur,
    but I think I've managed to give it the slip. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too!
    The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries.
    Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest.
    I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. Come along, Pond!
    Butterfingers. You were expecting someone else?
</p>

<h4>H4 - Then, all things considered...it's time I grew up</h4>
<p>
    I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them.
    A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points,
    but it is by no means the most interesting. Have faith, Brigadier.
    Have I ever led you astray? Geronimo! I am not a student of human nature.
    I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part.
    Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…?
    Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person.
</p>

<h5>H5 - That's a relief. I hate babysitters</h5>
<p>
    Please just... just see me. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it!
    Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors!
    My carer. She cares so I don't have to. I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow.
    Oh, good grief. Would you like a jelly baby? As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.
    You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! Our lives are different from anybody else’s.
    That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing.
</p>
<h6>H6 - Why is there never a big red button?</h6>
<p>
    Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds.
    Nothing can be eternal. A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space.
    T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
    The world's about to end, and here I am, stuck in traffic. Frightened people.
    Give me a Dalek any day. Brave heart, Clara. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book.
    Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings!
